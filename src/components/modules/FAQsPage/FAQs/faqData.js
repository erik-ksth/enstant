    answer:
      `enstant.com's On-Line Tool reduces time and stress traditionally associated with ordering business cards by speeding up ordering and proofing processes via your own customized web site. After entering the data such as name, title, etc. for your order, you can instantly preview electronic artwork of how the card will actually look. This eliminates the traditional paper and fax proofing cycles and prevents errors. Also, all your orders are archived so when you need to reorder them next time, just search for your previous order, update new info and submit order for printing. This speeds up ordering process by eliminating redundant data entry! The archived database also allows you to check order and shipping history.This eliminates playing "phone tag" with your printer and gives you total control in managing your orders!`,
